I "scraped" this website (https://www.washingtonian.com/2024/01/24/the-100-very-best-restaurants-in-washington-dc-2024/) to get the name of restaurants and their websites into an excel file, so that I could more easily plan my next snacks. I put scrape in quotation marks, because I ran into problems trying to scrape the actual website, so I just copied the websites html and put it into a static file then scraped the data off that fle. That file is included in the repo.
